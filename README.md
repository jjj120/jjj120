Hi, I'm Jonas, studying [Computer engineering](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/bachelor/computer-engineering/) at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/) since 2022. 

Currently trying to learn all, from coding to hardware and electronics. 

In my free time I play arround with various electronics in combination with the Raspberry Pi Pico, for the most part trying to get them running, so I can learn how it works.
